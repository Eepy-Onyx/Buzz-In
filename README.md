# Buzz-In

This is a very basic script that gathers all messages sent in chat with "!buzzin" before it, picks a random message, and displays it! Good for viewer interatction and for indecisive people like me-

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
  OBS_Websockets_Password: The password found in your Websocket settings
  TwitchAuth: An Auth token your twitch account, at least with perms to read and send to chat

This is a fairly basic script, and I do hope to make this easier to follow in the future. Thank you!
(Oh also this is the first time I've messed with GitHub, sorry if I do something wrong!)
